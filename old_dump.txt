In this talk, I will present our recent work on learning user preferences aided by unlabeled data. The key idea of our method is to conduct a semi-supervised learning in the self-training framework by gradually labeling unlabeled data and repeatedly re-training using the most confidently classified instance pairs. An advantage of our method is that it is able to mine and utilize the data information of the unlabeled data so as to improve the performance of the classifier. Based on this framework, we present a graph representation of the tranductive preference learning problem and formulate the preference ranking problem as a process for constructing a Hamiltonian path on a directed graph. We also develop a method for ranking top-$k$ instances.

For example, lung CT images have artifacts due to breathing which can effect radiation treatment planning for cancer patients. We generate models of lung motion from slice samples which only capture part of the lung at a specific part of the breath. The pose (or position in the breath) of slice samples must be estimated from only the image data. The same section of lung will be imaged in many poses leading to redundancy. We leverage this redundancy by only generating one underlying data volume, and using b-spline deformations to generate the remaining space. This has the advantage of inherently including motion information. Furthermore, it is able to interpolate over missing poses. The computation of derivatives of the cost function with respect to the b-spline deformation parameters and estimates of pose allows the use of a general solver to compute the model efficiently. A good initial condition for the pose estimates is crucial, and is obtained using manifold learning techniques.

Through offline preprocessing MPRA transforms an NP-hard utility optimization problem to the evaluation of a piecewise linear function of the CPU utilization. At run time MPRA produces optimal solutions by evaluating the function based on the CPU utilization. Analysis and simulation results show that MPRA maximizes system utility in the presence of varying workloads, while reducing the online computation complexity to polynomial time.'),(59,12,0,30,23,'dss','Understanding Social Interactions Through Games','The robotics community is steadily developing more sophisticated mobile robots, and there is a great deal of interest in putting these systems into use in everyday life.

All methods in the first category rely mainly on evolutionary conservations throughout species to eliminate a large number of false positive predictions. However, recently several studies reported many non-conserved miRNA genes, which were beyond the ability of these methods. In the second category, supervised classification models were trained on a positive set of genuine miRNA precursors and a negative set of hairpins obtained from exon regions of protein-coding genes. However, it is difficult to prepare negative training sets because many sequenced genomes are poorly annotated. Moreover, miRNA genes are located in intergenic regions or introns. For the methods in both categories, a nontrivial set of positive samples (known miRNAs) are required, yet, for many sequenced genomes, very few miRNAs have been reported. This is especially true in the case of viral genomes where not many miRNAs exist in the small genomes and even fewer have been identified. In order to overcome the limitations of the available methods, we have proposed two different novel algorithms. In one algorithm, high-throughput sequencing data was integrated, and accuracy of the prediction was significantly improved. The most important feature of this method is that it does not rely on phylogenetic profiling, thus it can be applied on identifying non-conserved miRNAs as well as conserved ones. The other algorithm was designed to predict miRNAs for species with few known miRNAs and/or poor annotations. miRNA prediction is viewed as a problem of information retrieval, and novel miRNAs was retrieved by the known miRNAs from the candidate pool. The retrieval process was modeled by belief propagation on a weighted graph, and a novel ranking algorithm based on the random walks method was proposed.

These applications are primarily used for content delivery (e.g. BitTorrent), telephony, and video. There has been substantial research on the performance of the BitTorrent, but more recently BitTorrent has become a source of much controversy. BitTorrent achieves high download rates and robustness using random peer selection, which is oblivious to the underlying network topology. Thus, BitTorrent often routes traffic along network links that are costly to ISPs. As a result, ISPs have turned to installing network devices to detect and throttle BitTorrent traffic, and BitTorrent in turn has begun obfuscating its traffic to avoid ISP-detection. These actions only perpetuate a \"cat and mouse\" game between ISPs and BitTorrent developers. Their core objectives, maintaining profit margins (ISPs) and improving performance (BitTorrent), are irreconcilable without explicit cooperation. Therefore, we propose a network-aware BitTorrent extension, Symbiotic P2P (sP2P), which reduces network utilization without degrading client performance by augmenting the BitTorrent protocol with information provided by ISPs. Specifically, ISPs provide intelligent network devices that inform BitTorrent about additional local peers and the cost of the underlying network. Using this information, BitTorrent favors peers on less expensive network paths.'),(69,22,0,30,61,'dss','Atomic Networks: high-performance concurrency control in programmable routers','Atomic (transactional) programming provides the foundation for scalable and reliable distributed applications.

While later works [Amenta 2004] have improved the vector field and energy function, the surface construction process remains indirect. We propose a grid-based algorithm that directly extracts the extremal surface geometry, given a smooth vector field and energy function.

Recently, diverse computing systems are being deployed in the high-performance computing domain to solve scientific problems that challenge traditional parallel processing clusters. These systems can outperform traditional clusters by using processors that are somewhat specialized to the computation instead of a set of homogeneous general-purpose processors. There is a trade-off of lower programability for better power efficiency and performance, however. Debugging applications and performance tuning on these computers is typically much more time-consuming and error-prone than homogeneous multiprocessors due to the increased complexity.\n\nMy research aims to improve performance debugging by providing a runtime monitor to assess the performance of the different components during execution. The monitor then presents a global view of the application performance on the diverse system to the developer in its entirety. In addition, the performance monitoring infrastructure provides the ability to validate performance assertions specified by the developer. By monitoring only what is important to the developer, the overhead of the monitoring framework can be greatly reduced. In this talk, I will describe my approach to measuring and validating the runtime performance of an application deployed on such a system.

Our objective is to find a schedule for transmissions over the network such that all the packets can be delivered to the intended receivers and that all end-to-end deadlines are met. Because WirlessHART has been specifically designed for reliable data delivery in process industry applications, the specific requirements of the standard render the problem different from existing real-time and multi-channel scheduling. We propose an optimal solution of this open problem for WirlessHART networks. We make the first attempt for transmission scheduling that considers real-time issues, bidirectional communication, and scalability in terms of both network size and number of applications in WirelessHART networks. We first give a mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem and provide a method to analyze its feasibility. We then propose a polynomial time optimal algorithm that can schedule all transmissions whenever a feasible schedule exists. We demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm through both theoretical and empirical analysis. The algorithm as applied to WirelessHART test cases through numerical simulations shows its effectiveness in real-time scheduling with a marked performance in execution time even for very large networks with reasonably large number of applications.

Even if they can survive the early birth, many of those babies still have to face lifetime health challenges, such as breathing problems, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, among others. The reason for the high risk of mental health problems in preterm babies is the rapid and extensive development of the brain during the last trimester of gestation. It is therefore important for physicians to be able to monitor the brain development in preterm babies so that they can provide necessary assistance. In order to track and analyze the development of the brain, we need to find a meaningful correspondence between the surfaces of the brain at different stages. We consider a combination of shape features, shape properties, and local strain when establishing this correspondence. Shape features are important because we want to map the same landmarks from one surface to the other. Where there are no such landmarks to act as anchors, shape properties (curvature for example) can guide the mapping process. In regions with neither landmarks nor distinctive shape properties, we want a mapping such that the strain on the deformed surface is distributed evenly. Our approach combines these constraints (strain, shape features and local shape properties) into an energy function and minimizes this function to obtain a mapping between two surfaces. Given two input surfaces, we first identify features on both surfaces. We then compute an initial mapping using conformal parameterization. Finally we use an iterative gradient descent approach to minimize the energy function. In this talk, I will present our results for the strain computation and relaxation for a deformed surface.

Formal analysis and extensive simulation shows LTCM can control temperature of multicore processors effectively over a broad range of working conditions while enforcing utilization bound.'),(204,91,1,30,102,'dss','RT-Xen: Real-Time Virtualization Based on Hierarchical Scheduling','The ability to build systems of systems is vital to the real-time community as we endeavor to build increasingly sophisticated systems. Subsystems must be modular and isolated to ensure desired real-time performance when assembled by the system integrator. While virtualization has gained broad adoption and success for system integration in non-real-time domains, no existing virtual machine manager is designed to enforce real-time performance. On the other hand, while a rich body of promising theories on hierarchical real-time scheduling algorithms has been proposed in the literature to support composable real-time performance guarantees, they have not been incorporated and evaluated in real virtualized systems. We have developed RT-Xen, the first virtual machine manager designed to support real-time domains through hierarchical real-time scheduling. RT-Xen bridges the gap between virtualization and hierarchical scheduling by introducing a hierarchical real-time scheduling framework in Xen, the most widely used open-source virtual machine manager. Experimental evaluation revealed important insights on the feasibility and efficacy of real-time virtualization: (1) RT-Xen can effective provide virtualization and scheduling to Linux guest OSes at 1~ms scheduling resolution (quantum) while incurring moderate overhead; (2) RT-Xen can provide real-time performance isolation against overrun domains; (3) RT-Xen significantly outperformed the standard credit-based Xen scheduler in terms of real-time performance. RT-Xen represents a promising step toward real-time virtualization for system integration of real-time applications.'),(205,92,0,30,62,'dss','Optimizing Expected Time Utility in Cyber-Physical Systems Schedulers','Classical scheduling abstractions such as deadlines and priorities do not readily capture the complex timing semantics found in many real-time cyber-physical systems. Time utility functions provide a necessarily richer description of timing semantics, but designing utility-aware scheduling policies using them is an open research problem. In particular, scheduling design that optimizes expected utility accrual is needed for real-time cyber-physical domains.\n\nWe present work on designing scheduling policies that optimize expected utility accrual for cyber-physical systems with periodic, non-preemptable tasks that run with stochastic duration. These policies are derived by solving a Markov Decision Process formulation of the scheduling problem. We use this formulation to demonstrate that our technique improves on existing heuristic utility accrual scheduling policies.'),(206,92,1,30,74,'dss','Rank Product Beyond Transcription','The non-parametric \'rank product\' method has performed well in head-to-head comparisons of methods of microarray analysis of gene transcription. It does well in both sensitivity and selectivity and is robust to noisy data. Additionally, it is simple and intuitive which is highly desirable in multi-discipline collaborations. Here we generalize the formulation of rank product allowing it to be used whenever appropriate probabilities can be calculated. In this form, the technique is more widely applicable and may be helpful in contexts where measurements come in a few sets of readings from a large set of noisy attributes or sensors and in which the goal is to find which attributes or sensors provide reliable, high-confidence detection of change in the events represented by the sets. Here we apply it to finding high confident protein-DNA-binding events by combining multiple noisy high-throughput experiments.

Mercury BLASTN is an FPGA-based accelerator for DNA sequence similarity search using Bloom filters which provide dramatically reduced runtime. These Bloom filters can potentially be further expedited if ported to a GPU. A parallel GPU-based implementation is proposed for this purpose. A test bench is also set up to examine the False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) as well as the runtime. Result shows that the design has a pretty close sensitivity to theory prediction, but the runtime is currently not as expected due to the hashing functions used. The result also suggests a performance model in which the sensitivity and time are quantified tradeoffs.'),(208,93,1,30,94,'dss','Improving Tools for Search-Based Short-Reads Alignment','The development of next-generation DNA sequencing technology has led to a proliferation of genome data in the last few years. Many bioinformatics applications require approximate alignments of the short sequences generated by this technology to a long reference sequence; consequently, space- and time-efficient indexing and approximate search on long reference sequences is an active area of research. A family of tools developed in 2009 based on a data structure called the Burrows-Wheeler Transform has enabled human-genome-sized datasets to be indexed and searched efficiently on a single desktop machine. Here we analyze the open-source tool BWA as a representative of this family. We show the unexpected existence of favorable locality in the BWA algorithm’s main data structure access pattern and explore possible sources of this locality. We also suggest ways to exploit locality to improve the tool’s performance.

The first two properties of light are encoded as intensity and color by our visual systems. The third property of light, polarization, for which humans have no innate receptor, captures various intrinsic properties of the imaged environment, such as shape and index of refraction. We have designed, fabricated and tested a 1 Mega-pixel polarization imaging sensor by depositing aluminum nanowire filters on top of a CCD imaging sensor. This new tool may have future applications in many fields, including biology, astrophysics, and medicine, but the quality of the camera needs to be understood. Just as with monolithically integrated color imagers, methods of characterizing the performance and accuracy of polarization imagers need to be developed. This talk will focus on methods we have used to test the accuracy of our imager. It will also describe a proposed method of camera calibration used to partially compensate for noise sources introduced during manufacture.'),(212,95,1,30,103,'dss','microRNA discovery through high-throughput sequencing technology','We applied deep sequencing technology to small RNA fractions from cells lytically-infected with murine -herpesvirus 68 ( HV68) in order to define in detail small RNAs generated from a cluster of tRNA-related polycistronic structures located at the left end of the viral genome. We detected nine new candidate microRNAs (miRNAs), five of which were detected by Northern blot analysis. In addition, we determined that previously annotated viral miRNA molecules were not necessarily represented as the most abundant sequence originating from a transcript. Based on these new small RNAs and previously reported HV68 miRNAs, we were able to further define annotate the distinctive &#947;HV68 tRNA-miRNA structures. We used this deep sequencing data and computational analysis to identify similar structures in the mouse genome, and validated that these host structures also give rise to small RNAs. This reveals a possible convergent usage of tRNA/polymerase III (pol III) transcripts to generate small RNAs from both mammalian and viral genomes.'),(213,96,0,30,NULL,'dss',NULL,NULL),(214,96,1,30,NULL,'dss',NULL,NULL),(215,99,0,30,86,'dss','End-to-End Delay Analysis for Fixed Priority Scheduling in WirelessHART Networks','The WirelessHART standard has been specifically designed for real-time communication between sensor and actuator devices for industrial process monitoring and control.

In this work, we map the scheduling of real-time periodic data flows in a WirelessHART network to real-time multiprocessor scheduling. We, then, exploit the response time analysis for multiprocessor scheduling and propose a novel method for the end-to-end delay analysis of the real-time flows that are scheduled using a fixed priority scheduling policy in a WirelessHART network. Simulations based on both random topologies and real network topologies of a physical testbed demonstrate the efficacy of our end-to-end delay analysis in terms of acceptance ratio under various fixed priority scheduling policies.'),(216,99,1,30,19,'dss','Toward Transforming Freely Available Source Code into Usable Learning Materials for End-Users','The availability of example source code on the web presents an array of potential learning resources for any code consumer.

With end-user programmers increasingly relying on example code on the web, any difficulty can prevent these code resources from reaching their potential as learning materials for users who may see the greatest benefits: inexperienced end-users.\n\nIn this talk we focus on one problem area: supporting inexperienced end-users in selecting relevant code sections from examples they find interesting. We present two interfaces, Hastings and Dinah, designed to support the bi-directional code search strategies employed by non-programmers during code selection tasks. We show how non-programmers using Hastings for code selection tasks significantly outperformed non-programmers using a debugger, and how performance barriers directly contributed to the design of Dinah.

NDN names the content rather than the hosts. The NDN naming strategy has hierarchical structures that makes it possible to apply well studied IP forwarding methods. The length of IP address is fixed, and current techniques can support IP forwarding in line speed. Whereas, NDN packets are forwarded based on variable-length content names, which increases the time and space costs significantly for packet processing. In addition, NDN forwarding requires fast updates in forwarding nodes, making NDN packet forwarding more challenging. As a result, more time- and space-efficient data structures and algorithms are demanded to solve the NDN packet forwarding problem. And specialized hardware devices, such as TCAMs, need to be employed to assist NDN packet processing.\n\nThis talk presents the NDN architecture and its prototype implementation developed by PARC. The detailed NDN packet forwarding plane and preliminary performance study of the NDN implementation are presented. We also discuss the possible methods of improving the NDN forwarding plane performance.'),(220,101,1,30,96,'dss','Cheshire Cat: A Framework for Automatically Generating Adaptive Interactive Tutorials','Currently, most tutorials are manually created and cannot be readily adapted to the needs of individual users.

This framework can gracefully adapt to changes in data and the configuration of the user interface. Further, the Cheshire Cat framework can enable application developers to readily support additional features such as undo and redo across multiple sessions, internationalization, localization, and user interface analysis.

However, despite nearly two decades of research and hundreds of systems, even simple pervasive applications remain difficult to develop. To this end, we propose a substrate for pervasive computing that focuses on two issues faced by all pervasive computing systems: device interfacing and distributed applications. For device interfacing, we present open devices as a generic component-based model for physical devices and software objects.

These algorithms have aided in the study and understanding of many real systems. However, they have achieved only moderate network structural inference accuracy.\n\nIn recent years, the identification of putative regulator protein binding sites (TFBS), which indicate a greater potential for protein binding DNA sequence and regulating the transcription of a target gene, has improved dramatically.

We present a new inference algorithm, N-Sieve, for predicting regulatory network structure from gene expression data. The most significant contribution of our approach is the way in which we take advantage of genetic perturbations in the data. Due to attenuation in regulatory networks, the most significant effects of genetic perturbations tend to be locally distributed in the structure. We formulate this observation as a Bayesian prior on the structure of the probabilistic model . Using this approach we demonstrate considerable advantages compared to other algorithms on community developed benchmarks.
