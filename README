0. Introduction
%%%%%

So you have volunteered to be a DSS chair. Good for you! It's more than just
a bullet point on your CV; it also gives you valuable academic skills. These
are probably the first sessions you will ever chair! Hopefully your academic
career will require chairing more sessions in the future, so running DSS is
great practice. Also, being a DSS chair gives you practice in organizing and
running events. If you do a good job, people will notice, especially the
faculty. Finally, chairing DSS gives you the opportunity to listen to many
talks. If a talk is good, you learn how to give a good talk, while if it is
bad, you learn what you think is bad in a talk and hopefully you can avoid
the same mistakes. Plus, of course, DSS is good for everyone else in the
department. And somebody needs to do it.

A word of advice: do not get bogged down in trying to make everyone happy.
This is a volunteer position. You can only go so far. Do not let people
convince you to do lots of unnecessary shuffling around of schedules or to
make unreasonable exceptions. As long as you tell people ahead of time what
is expected of them, you should expect them to do it. If they do not, do
whatever is most convenient for you. In the end, if someone just will not
go along with you, it is they who look bad. And remember also: it is not
your job to make them do it. You can always defer to the chair of the
Doctoral Program Committee (aka Dr Pless in 2011), who can deal with
problem cases.

Another point to keep in mind: you are going to have a fair bit of
information about people. A lot of this stuff is not exactly confidential,
but you should try to be discreet about it.

Otherwise, this can be a lot of fun! Get out in front of people and make
a speech! Get everything organized just how you want it! Enjoy yourself!

1. Getting set up.
%%%%%

Perform the following commands:

    $ ssh yourseasname@ssh.seas.wustl.edu
    $ cd /research-www/engineering/dss.cse/dss
    $ ../local/bin/python manage.py createsuperuser
	
And follow the onscreen steps.  Congratulations, you're now a DSS superuser.  Don't tell anybody about how easy that was.

%%%%%
2. Scheduling
%%%%%

The work of running DSS is split into two parts, scheduling the students and
running the talks. Scheduling should start about a month before the semester
starts, so at the end of July for the Fall schedule, and at the end of
December or the beginning of January for the Spring schedule. Alternatively,
you can schedule for a whole year in the summer.  

This system used to work by doing a LOT of in-database editing, and making sure
that you constantly backed up the SQL database before doing anything.  Now,
everything is web-based, which should make your job substantially easier.  If
you want, you should go see Dan Lazewatsky and Austin Abrams and give them each
a 6-pack of Blue Moon, Newcastle Brown Ale, or Schlafly Pale Ale as thanks.

Here are the steps to create a DSS schedule:

1. Log into your superuser account by going to

   http://dss.cse.wustl.edu/admin

   And clicking on "Login".  Go back to http://dss.cse.wustl.edu/admin, and 
   there should now be a few admin options.  Click on "Manage DSS Schedule".

2. At the top of the page, there should be a bullet point that says "Make a new
   schedule for Fall/Spring yyyy".  Fill in the appropriate details, and press 
   submit.  You now have an empty DSS schedule for that semester, which defaults
   to placing an event every Friday from January 23 - April 30 for the Spring
   semester, and September 15 through December 5 for the Fall Semester.

3. Go get a copy of the school's academic calendar, and find out which dates 
   overlap with official university holidays or breaks.  Let's suppose that
   October 14 was scheduled as a DSS event, but it's actually Fall Break.  Go to
   the top of the admin schedule page, and create a new "Break" event for
   October 14, and fill in the appropriate details.  Create that new event, and 
   the schedule should change, with a second event on October 14, which says 
   "There will be no seminar due to Fall Break."  Find the old DSS event 
   scheduled for that date, and delete that event by clicking on the "Delete 
   this event" on the right side of the page.

4. If you anticipate that there will be more events than students can fill, feel
   free to add a Hot Topics event in lieu of a regular DSS event.  This is a bit 
   more freeform, but in the past we've had successful Hot Topics events, and 
   it's a good way to get the department to pay for pizza.  Creating a Hot
   Topics event is similar to creating a Break.

5. Now that you know which dates will have DSS events, it's time to schedule
   some students into those events.  Go back to 

   http://dss.cse.wustl.edu/admin

   And click on "Email/Schedule Students"

6. This is a list of all currently-known students in the department.  Through 
   this interface, we can select students and email them or schedule them in 
   large groups.
	
   Find out which students must give their DSS talk in the next two 
   semesters, select them by clicking on their checkboxes, and scroll to the 
   bottom of the page.  Make sure that the button is set to "Email Students",
   and click "Submit".

7. This will bring up an interface where you can write emails to students.
   There are already a few templates that you should probably use.  Under
   "Email Template", choose SubmitPrefs (it may already be selected).  On the 
   left-hand side is a Django-style template of the email, which is just a
   fancy way to draft your email and fill it with person-specific parameters.
   The right-hand side of this page shows a preview of what one of the students
   will see.

   The SubmitPrefs template should work fine for now, so just click on "Send 
   Mail".  DO NOT PRESS THE SUBMIT BUTTON MORE THAN ONCE.  This is sending
   email to a bunch of students across the department, and they will receive
   the email more than once if you press the submit button again.  It will
   probably take a few minutes, so just go get something to drink and come back.

8. Assuming everything went well, you'll be put back on the student dashboard.
   Notice that for all the students you just emailed, we keep a timestamp of 
   which email we sent which students.

   Wait for people to respond. They will each get sent a URL by the
   SubmitPrefs email, allowing them to state their preferences and request
   exemptions. You can see what people are entering by going to

   http://dss.cse.wustl.edu/admin

   and clicking on "View Schedule Preferences".

   Note that the rules for exemptions are in the email. If you have any
   questions about what should be an exemption, ask the Doctoral Program
   Committee chair (aka Dr Pless in 2011).

9. A few days before people are supposed to have responded, check for
   stragglers (on the list of students that you can email, there is a column 
   that corresponds to if a student has or has not yet responded to the latest
   email sent).  I have found that most of the time these are people whose
   email address is incorrect or who are just ignoring you because they
   are no longer actually in the PhD program. Check with one of the
   secretaries (aka Madeline in 2011) about these people. If they really
   are supposed to be presenting, try to talk to them in person, to make
   sure you have the right email address and to make sure they know that
   they really do have to respond. You can update a student's email
   address by going to

   http://dss.cse.wustl.edu/admin

   and clicking on "Create/Modify/Delete Students".

10. Once you're ready to build up the schedule, click on "Email/Schedule 
	Students".  To schedule a group of students, select them, make sure 
	"Schedule Students" is selected, and click "Submit".  This will create a 
	scheduling optimization problem (solved by Munkres algorithm, FYI) that will 
	try to maximize the "happiness" of everybody against their preferences.
	
	You should make sure to schedule the students that ABSOLUTELY MUST present
	next semester first, as one big group, and then after those have been
	scheduled, add in anybody that has filled out their preferences, and if
	there is still space, anybody that hasn't filled out any preferences.
	
	Remember, as DSS Chair, you're volunteering to do a pretty thankless job, so
	if someone says that they didn't get the email, or that they can't give
	their talk on the day they were scheduled, just tell them to try and find
	someone else to swap with or talk with the Doctoral Program Committee chair 
	(aka Dr Pless in 2011).  
	
	The assignment algorithm used is in fact optimal, so if a person was 
	scheduled on some day when they couldn't actually present, then moving them
	to any other day would cause one or more people to present on a day when
	they couldn't, and someone's gotta take the fall.
	
11. About a week before a student is scheduled to give a talk, use the email
    interface to send them the SubmitAbstract email.  This will prompt the
    student to fill in information about their talk.  If a student neglects
    to fill in this information, you are free to fill it in yourself courtesy
    of the Automatic CS Paper Generator, found here:

	http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/

12. Give yourself a great big pat on the back!!!

4. Remaining TODOs
%%%%%

(TODO: Put the rules for exemptions in the email, and allow a user to request 
	an exemption)

(TODO: Send out emails after being scheduled)

(TODO: Ajaxify the send_email page so that the admin can see progress.)

(TODO: Automatically send email to the department advertising this week's DSS events)

(TODO: Upload a video to the server)

(BIG TODO: How do we find out which students are active and/or which students 
	have to give a talk in the next semester?  Maybe send Madeline a way to mark 
	this?)
